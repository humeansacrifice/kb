Topics and Categories are used to organize articles. Categories are the "parent" and topics are the "child". They are loosely structured, and not enforced. If you create a new category or topic, you'll need to the following:

1. Add the category or topic to its corresponding array in the ```_config.yml``` file.
2. Create a corresponding [all-CATEGORYNAME-articles or all-TOPIC-TOPICNAME-articles page](page_types.html). The easiest way to do so is to duplicate an existing page and change the frontmatter for your new category or topic.
