# kb


Don't read this.

I hate literally every single KB layout/website/system I've ever met and I wanted to make my own. After several empty threats of "I'm going to make my own damn KB", I finally decided to get drunk and do it. Some of it works, some of it doesn't -- I have no idea what I'm doing, so it may take a while.

Do whatever you want with it, but don't be a jerk.

## To do:

- Write Tag logic and display.
- Make search work better and not bork out when it's on article pages.
- Generate and add linked "Category List" to index.
- Figure out Breadcrumb nav. It'll be cool.
- Document _everything_
- ~~figure out how in the hell i ended up with two page.html files, and get rid of the _includes_ one.~~
- ~~make the CSS not suck.~~ it's never gonna not suck.
