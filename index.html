<p>Skrifa is a Jekyll theme for Knowledge Bases. I learned Liquid and Jekyll, and built it in one drunk weekend, so it's not quite perfect.</p>
<p>I borrowed some code and stole piles of inspiration from Tom Johnson's <a href="https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/documentation-theme-jekyll">Jekyll Documentation Theme.</a>
Skrifa is using <a href="bootswatch.com">Bootswatch's</a> rad-ass Bootstrap <a href="http://bootswatch.com/flatly/">Flatly Theme.</a></p>

<p>Oh yeah, this theme doesn't use posts. I'm sure you could add them, but that's on you, bro.</p>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some of the CSS is hacky. It's minimal and limited to the TOC and some unordered list items. I don't understand CSS.</li>
<li>The search doesn't work well. I was too drunk to try to get it to work the way I wanted it to. It's on my roadmap.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href={{site.baseurl}}/articles-by-category.html>See all articles in all categories</a></h3>
